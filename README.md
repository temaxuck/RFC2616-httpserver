## Usage

#### TODO: Quick-start guide

There are 4 levels of logs: `TODO`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`. To disable any of
them you should simply redefine macro `HTTP_<LEVEL>(...)` to nothing at the
top of the script, e.g.:

```c
#define HTTP_TODO(...)
#define HTTP_INFO(...)
#define HTTP_WARN(...)
#define HTTP_ERROR(...)

#define HTTP_PARSER_IMPL
#include "parser.h"
#define HTTP_SOCK_IMPL
#include "socket.h"

// rest of your code
```
