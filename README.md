# RFC2616 HTTP Server

An implementation of an HTTP server in C, following [RFC 2616 Hypertext
Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616).

> [!WARNING]
> This project was created **solely for learning purposes** â€” to explore how
> one might implement a simple HTTP server in C.

## Usage

Here's an example of **main.c**:
```c
#define HTTP_IMPL
#include "http.h"

int main(void) {
    HTTP_Server s = {.addr=":8080"};
    return http_server_run_forever(&s);
}
```

There are 4 levels of logs: `TODO`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`. To disable any of
them you should simply redefine macro `HTTP_<LEVEL>(...)` to nothing before
including `http.h`, e.g.:
```c
#define HTTP_TODO(...)
#define HTTP_INFO(...)
#define HTTP_WARN(...)
#define HTTP_ERROR(...)

#define HTTP_IMPL
#include "http.h"
```
